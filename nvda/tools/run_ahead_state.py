"""Run ahead against the lockstep, as FIRMWARE AND BOARD STATE at semantic checkpoints, then under the same continuation
(Astra, Reply 107).  Through bl.dll with the driver's boot.

A matching register prefix does not establish future equivalence, and the two machines' clocks cannot match cycle
for cycle: run ahead runs the unit ahead of the chip and then holds its CPU while the script plays.  So the units are
compared where they mean the same thing -- the checkpoints -- and given the same continuation afterwards:

  boot         the driver's boot, before any say (both lockstep: a sanity check)
  said         a two-line say, done, then 0.5 s with no input
  setting      a rate setting sent, then 0.5 s
  faster       a say at the new rate, done, 0.5 s
  cancelled    a three-line say cancelled 0.5 s in (the unit run ahead has read further when ^X reaches it)
  respoken     a say at once after the cancel, done, 0.5 s
  clicked off  12 s with no input (the firmware clicks the channel off ~10 s after speech: port A0 bit 1, R3 = 00)
  after        a last say, done, 0.5 s

At each: the RAM (40000h-FFFFFh, its length too) and the file flash; the serial bytes the unit sent during the step
(^F echoes, XON/XOFF); queued serial input, a ^X in flight, the unit's XOFF; the braille-key latch; the channel power
(port A0 bit 1) and port E0; the SSI-263 registers as the unit wrote them and as the chip holds them; A/R as the unit
sees it and /INT1 (the pending speech interrupt), /INT2, IFF1/2, IM, HALT/SLP; the ASCI's registers; the host's ^F
accounting (sent, echoed, stale, owed) and input held.  Then every step's write values.  A checkpoint that never
reaches the idle loop (asleep, SP D3FE) within 50 ms fails; so do memories of different lengths.

INTENTIONAL differences, listed, not gated: the CPU's cycle count (run ahead's unit ran ahead, then waited); per
checkpoint, the RAM cells and probe fields that also differ there between LOCKSTEP runs whose only difference is
timing (steps 0.125-0.5 ms, 0.06-0.2 s more idle) -- never a union over the session, which let a difference at one
checkpoint hide one at another; the stack below SP; and NAMED cells, each from a trace build's watchpoints (the
routine that writes it, and when):
  every checkpoint    CLOCK: the firmware's seconds counters (its timer interrupt counts CPU time)
  from 'cancelled'    RESIDUE: what the unit read ahead of the listener before ^X -- the line-staging buffer, the
                      banked-call save slots
  at 'cancelled'      the unit's serial output, ^F accounting and chip request (the same registers: the pause after
                      ^X, its timer), write values up to the cut (a cancel-prefix match); Spanish, its text index
  after it            a redundant XON (the flow state the same)
Anything else that differs is a FINDING and fails.

RESULTS (2026-09-30).  Without the cancel, and with it (a three-line say cancelled 0.5 s in, then a say at once),
English and Spanish: every checkpoint agrees under those names, and every write value after the cancel.  Before the
fix the English respoken utterance began with phonemes of the cancelled text (writes differ at 12 of 175/181, its
text buffer shifted by one: a character of the cancelled line survived ^X); the control puts that back.  The
mechanism and its sweeps: run_ahead_cancel.py.  The stack page is inferred from where timing alone differs (below
SP), not read from the MMU: cpu.h exposes no MMU registers.

    python run_ahead_state.py [--es] [--no-cancel]
    RUN_AHEAD_STATE_BREAK=1: one RAM byte changed (must fail); =settle: run_ahead.h's RA_BRK_SETTLE (must fail)
The internal timers and interrupt flags of the Z180 itself are not exposed (src/csrc/cpu/cpu.h): not compared.
