"""Does the Braille Lite driver keep the unit's channel open after speaking, as the real unit does?

After speech the real unit's channel stays open -- its hiss or whine goes on -- until the firmware clicks it off
(R3 = 00, ~9.95 s after the last phoneme on Tomi's unit).  With "keep the channel open" and the hiss or whine on, the
driver keeps the emulated unit running in real time after "done" (listeners, 2026-09-29).  The real driver under
stand-in NVDA; the tail's clock is sped up SPEED times.

  A  hiss, keep open: 8.5-11 s of audible hiss after "done", ending with the firmware's click-off (R3 = 00)
  B  new speech 2 s into the tail: the tail stops (the idle audio before the new speech is ~2 s, not ~10)
  C  keep open OFF (the control): nothing after "done"
  D  hiss off, keep open on: nothing after "done"

  E  the first speech after the click-off starts no later than with keep open off
  F  speech interrupting the open channel (cancel, then speak) starts no later than with keep open off

    python keep_open_test.py            KEEP_OPEN_BREAK=1: case A runs with keep open off -- the test must fail
                                        KEEP_OPEN_BREAK=mute: every fed sample silent -- passes only if A, B and E/F each fail
