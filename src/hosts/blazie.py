"""Blazie firmware (Braille Lite 2000, June 2003 BL2ENG) driving the engine's SSI-263.

The firmware runs in z180emu (`bns_live.exe --live`, GPLv2) as a child process; this
host runs the SSI-263 model and closes the loop: the unit's register writes arrive
as "W reg val" lines and are applied to the chip at the current chip time, and the
chip's A/R request goes back as "A 1" / "A 0", so the firmware's inflection tokens
and phoneme timing happen live instead of being replayed from a batch.

Neither the firmware nor the RAM snapshot (which contains it) is part of any
repository: pass your own paths.  Boot = the warm snapshot plus the speech-box key
chords (345, 123456, L, e), exactly as the MASTER harness did.

# ---- the optional idle whine, generated from the chip's own clock (Tomi's unit, blite_sweep W03, 2026-09-27) ----
# The unit's hiss and whine: a comb of lines at n x fc/64 (fc = the chip's filter clock, xck / (2 (256 - R4))), from a
# mod-64 counter that steps 256 - R4 per filter tick (Tomi's unit, sessions W02/W03).  Two classes, as Tomi hears
# them: EVEN volumes (6, the factory volume this host uses) give a slight hiss, ODD volumes the actual whine.
# The frequencies follow the chip's clock and tone register live; each line's LEVEL is measured, per tone: the
# median over the class's volumes of the W03 grid (every volume 1-15 x tone 0-26, 405 cells, idle 0.3-9 s after a
# line), dB re a loud vowel's mean square, kept where the line shows in at least half of them (blite_sweep
# analysis/whine_tone_fit.py).  Blind (fitted without volumes 7 and 13 / 6 and 12, scored on them): audible-line
# error median 2.6 dB for the whine, 5.9 for the hiss, against 20.1 and 14.6 for the 0.6.0 draft's one waveform for
# every tone, which put secondary lines up to ~30 dB too loud and missed the low tones (Tomi: "barely there below
# tone 7").  Phases were not measured: a fixed pseudo-random set (WHINE_SEED).  The chip's own two-sine carrier
# (carrier_rel_db) is switched off while this runs, since the table carries the fc line (n = 64).
