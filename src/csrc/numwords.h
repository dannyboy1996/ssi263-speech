/* numwords.h -- nvda/shared/ssi263_numwords.py in C, the parts a front end without Python needs: text as Python sees
 * it (UTF-8 to code points), currencies() and English normalise() (numbers as words).  Each function names the
 * Python it ports; change them together.  The Accent SA voice (accentsa/as_voice.c) uses them, and its Android test
 * holds them to the NVDA driver byte for byte (src/platforms/android/test/test_android_native.py); so does the
 * Speak-Out's (speakout/so_voice.c: currencies, nw_utf8, nw_isalnum; nvda/tools/so_voice_text_equiv.py).
 *
 * bl_voice.c (the Braille Lite's) carries its own copy of currencies() from before this file; it may move onto this
 * one.  MIT.
