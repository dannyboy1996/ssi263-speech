// i8085_mame.cpp -- cpu.h's 8085 on MAME's 8085 core: the CORRECTED path (CONTRACT.md 1-2, 4-7, 9).
//
// One translation unit: MAME's code (i8085_mame_machine.cpp, generated) is included here, so its helpers are seen by
// the step driver and inline into it.  Build this file; never i8085_mame_machine.cpp alone.
//
// The driver is ours.  It follows MAME's execute_run (i8085.cpp, the revision in mame_i8085/PINNED.txt) one step at
// a time, in the contract's phases:
//   A  execute_run's entry test at every step: TRAP whenever it is pending, the maskable sources only outside the
//      EI shadow (MAME's check_for_interrupts sets the priority and the masks).  A vectored acceptance pushes and
//      jumps; INTR is only accepted (IE cleared, HALT left): its instruction comes at E.  i8085_pc() is the
//      interrupted address.
//   B  the acceptance T-states (12: the extraction's I8085_ACCEPT_T, from Intel).
//   C  the EI shadow ends.
//   D  steps++, the saved PC, bus->boundary.
//   E  one instruction; or the injected one after an INTR acceptance, its bytes from the acknowledge; or one HALT
//      slot of 4 T-states (CONTRACT.md 6, model: MAME re-fetches the HLT at 5 T each time).
//   F  its T-states.  (The 8085 has no on-chip timers, serial port or DMA: nothing else is clocked, and G is empty.)
//
// Differences from MAME, each deliberate (the generated file marks those made there 'CHANGED'):
//   - Interrupts are sampled at every step's A (MAME: at execute_run's entry and when the EI shadow runs out, so a
//     line raised inside a slice waits for the next slice).
//   - Acceptance of TRAP and RST 5.5/6.5/7.5 is 12 T-states (Intel's RST on the 8085; MAME: 11, the 8080's).
//   - INTR: the instruction is injected at E (CONTRACT.md 4) with bus.irq_ack(ctx, I8085_INTR, n), n from 0 at each
//     acceptance; MAME reads and executes it inside the acceptance.  Its PC is held, a conditional branch not taken
//     included (MAME moves the PC by 2 there).
//   - SIM does not accept an interrupt inside its own step (MAME calls check_for_interrupts there); what it unmasks
//     is taken at the next step's A.
//   - A HALT slot is 4 T-states without a fetch (MAME re-executes the HLT, 5 T-states).
//   - TRAP and the RSTs make no acknowledge callback (no bus read happens for an internal RESTART).
// Known limits: the undocumented 8085 flags (V, K) are MAME's; the core is not bus-cycle accurate (an access inside
// an instruction is not placed at its own T-state; CONTRACT.md 7-8).
