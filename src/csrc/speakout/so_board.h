/* so_board.h -- the GW Micro Speak-Out (1995) around a V40 core (MAME's NEC core, ../cpu/v40_mame.cpp), as a
 * library: one instance per unit.
 *
 * The board is src/hosts/speakout.py's machine with the CPU replaced and nothing else changed (Astra and Tomi, the
 * scope of this step): 1 MB of RAM holding the firmware's Intel HEX; the SSI-263 memory-mapped at F000:FE00-FE04
 * (R0-R4; the firmware never reads it, and the RAM keeps what was written, as under Unicorn); the V40's ICU and SCU
 * reduced as that host reduces them (so_icu.h, so_scu.h); every other port reads 0 and ignores writes (the TCU, the
 * SCU's set-up, the V40's system registers FFF0h-FFFEh).  The chip's writes come back as a list, in order, per call;
 * the host (its SSI-263 model and its chip-time loop) applies them, as bl_board.h does for the Braille Lite.
 *
 * Power-on: the V40 starts at FFFF:0000; the board puts a far JMP to 0000:0100 there, runs it as the first step and
 * restores those five bytes, so the firmware starts where the Unicorn host starts it, with the same memory.
 *
 * Not thread-safe per instance; different instances may be used from different threads.  MIT.
