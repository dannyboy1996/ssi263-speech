/* am_host.h -- the Accent-mini host in C: src/hosts/accent.py's Accent, line for line, on the bare PC of ../pc86
 * (MAME's 8086 with 1 MB): Aicom's DOS driver SPKEMS.DVC loaded as DOS would load it from CONFIG.SYS, its INIT,
 * an expanded-memory manager (INT 67h, LIM 3.2/4.0 as far as the driver asks, the page frame copied in and out), the
 * BIOS/DOS services it calls, the card (data port 3EFh, control port 3EEh, A/R on IRQ2 through a one-request PIC) and
 * an SSI-263 (../ssi263.h), with text printed to the driver's LPT through INT 17h as a screen reader did.
 *
 * Time, as accent.py: each slice the IRQ is offered, the chip runs (to its next A/R request, at most `step`; or
 * step / 4 while requesting) and the CPU runs max(100, int(cpu_ips x dt)) instructions -- cpu_ips 5,000,000 is a
 * COMPATIBILITY POLICY kept from the Unicorn host, not a clock (Astra, Reply 104).  Every rounding and order of
 * operations is Python's: run_until_request's sample count is int() (truncation), run's round() (half to even).
 * A driver call that blocks (an option command waiting for the speech buffer to drain) runs the card meanwhile and
 * keeps its audio for the next run (pending); a text may be left with the driver in the background (amh_say's
 * background = say(background=True)), run() carrying on with it step for step.
 *
 * The driver comes from the caller, as bytes or a file; never built in.  The chip: the caller's, or (chip NULL) one
 * made from the built-in defaults (ssi263_default_params), which is what the NVDA driver's SSI263C is.
 *
 * Errors: what accent.py raises (an unimplemented service or port, a call still waiting after its limit, an opcode the
 * 8086 runs differently from the 80186) makes the host FAULT: the call returns -1, amh_error says why, and every later
 * call returns -1 too.  The NVDA driver restarts the card then; so does am_voice.
 *
 * Not thread-safe per instance; different instances may be used from different threads.  MIT.
