/* run_ahead.h -- an experimental, opt-in mode: a unit run ahead of its chip, for any board whose CPU drives an
 * SSI-263 and answers its A/R request (the Braille Lite's bl_board, the Type 'n Speak's tns_board, or another unit on
 * a Z180 or anything else).  It knows the chip's side only: which writes load a phoneme, when the chip requests the
 * next one.  Nothing of any firmware.  (Astra, Reply 107: what it is, what it is not, and its contract.)
 *
 * What it is: a BOUNDED STREAMING capture, not a whole-utterance drain.  The CPU runs flat out against a stand-in chip
 * that acknowledges every phoneme load (raises A/R) RA_ACK_S of CPU time later, and it is run only until the capture
 * holds RA_AHEAD segments (acknowledgements) beyond the one being played.  Each write is kept with its CPU cycle and
 * the number of acknowledgements before it (its segment).
 *
 * Replay: the real chip plays the script in real time.  Segment k starts at the chip's own k-th request, and each of
 * its writes follows at its CPU distance from the k-th acknowledgement: the unit's answer to a request, at the speed
 * this emulator gives it (emulated Z180 time: NOT a measurement of a real unit's chip bus).  Lane 2's deliberate
 * retiming (nvda/tools/run_ahead_lanes.py): a segment that opens after a pause load (code 00), or the utterance's
 * first, and whose first write came more than RA_READ_S after its acknowledgement (the unit was reading its next line,
 * as far as the English and Spanish corpora show) is moved up to RA_LAT (the unit's last in-speech answer), and after
 * a pause it does not wait for that pause to end either.  An answer slower than RA_READ_S after a spoken phoneme is
 * kept as it is: it is not "reading" (test_run_ahead.c's slow-service and threshold fixtures).
 * Lane 1 (ra_pace): the script at a given schedule instead -- the lockstep's own -- for timestamp and PCM identity.
 *
 * The end of the capture is INFERRED, not proven: it ends when the board says nothing more is owed (the Braille Lite
 * host: its ^F echo accounting, bh_owed) and the unit has written nothing for RA_QUIET_S of CPU time -- a policy.  If
 * the unit still owes speech after RA_LIMIT_S without a write, the capture ends as a LIMIT, never as a success.
 *
 * Completion (ra_state), four facts kept apart:
 *   capture exhausted  the capture ended by the quiet policy above (RA_END_QUIET)
 *   capture limit      it ended at RA_LIMIT_S with speech still owed (RA_END_LIMIT), or on an allocation failure
 *                      (RA_END_ALLOC: an explicit error; the script is never silently shortened)
 *   playback exhausted every captured write has been applied to the chip
 *   chip completion    ... and the final load has ended: the chip requests again.  Only this, after a capture
 *                      exhausted by the policy, is RA_COMPLETE.  The final load still sounding is not complete; if it
 *                      does not end within RA_FINAL_S the utterance ends as RA_LIMIT.
 * Before that, RA_TRAILING: the capture exhausted, every spoken load applied, a pause loaded after the last of them
 * and ended (the chip requests), and the rest of the script idle -- pauses and register writes, nothing spoken.  The
 * speech is over there (the host's "done"); the rest plays on in real time unless the host has input for the unit,
 * which may then apply it at once (ra_flush checks its content first) -- a deliberate retiming: those pauses are cut.
 * A limit or an error ends the run-ahead utterance (ra.active = 0) as that state; the host decides what follows (the
 * Braille Lite host goes on in lockstep, whose own policies then judge "done", or reports the error).
