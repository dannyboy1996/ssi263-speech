 *     else all 2 MB (bl_board.h, bl_save_state) -- then, when the clock controller was on, its 64 bytes.
 *   Type 'n Speak: 1 MB of RAM (the program at its start), the 4 MB flash, the clock's 64 bytes (tns_board.h).
 * The unit is told by the file's size.  The clock's bytes are kept as they are.  Portable C99 (stdio only).
