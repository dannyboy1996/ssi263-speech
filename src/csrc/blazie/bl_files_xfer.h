/* bl_files_xfer.h -- a unit's files out to a FAT disk image and back in (Tomi: "dump state file to .img", "use state
 * file from .img"; Jage and Jayson asked for a way without the serial cable).
 *
 * The image (fat_img.h: FAT16, opens in 7-Zip, mounts on Linux): one folder per folder the unit has, named as the unit
 * names it (blx_*_cp: in the unit's code page) -- "ram startup" and "flash startup" on an English unit, "RAM
 * inicial" and "FLASH inicial" on a Spanish Braille Lite, "ram subory" and "fles subory" (with their accents, cp852)
 * on the Slovak Braille 'n Speak 2000, and any the user made -- each holding the unit's files that are in it, under their unit names (as
 * long names), with their exact bytes, their time and date, and the read-only mark when the user protected them.
 * Text files are as the unit keeps them: a lone CR ends a line; a grade 2 file (type B: no extension or .brl on the
 * Braille Lite, .brl/.brf on the Type 'n Speak) holds its braille as ASCII braille, as a .brf file does -- it is not
 * translated.  The help file is not exported (its text is part of the firmware).
 *
 * Import makes the unit's files what the image holds:
 *   - a file whose name, folder and bytes match the unit's is left alone (so export, import, export gives the same
 *     image again);
 *   - other bytes for a file the unit has: the file rewritten where it is, its type and protection kept;
 *   - a file the unit lacks: added to the folder of its image folder (a flash folder: into flash; a RAM folder: into
 *     RAM).  A file at the top of the image goes to the flash startup folder (the RAM one if the flash is not set
 *     up).  An image folder the unit lacks becomes a new folder, a flash folder when the flash is set up.  Deeper
 *     folders are skipped.
 *   - a file the unit has that the image lacks: deleted -- except the clipboard, the datebook and the file the unit
 *     has open, which are kept;
 *   - in a text file (type A or B) a CR LF or a lone LF from a PC editor becomes the unit's CR;
 *   - names are made into names the unit takes (lower case, one dot, an extension of up to 3, 20 characters);
 *     renamed ones are listed.
 * Everything done, kept or refused is listed in the report, one line each.
 *
 * Portable C99.
