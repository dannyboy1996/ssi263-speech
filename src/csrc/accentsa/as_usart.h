/* as_usart.h -- the Accent SA's 8251 USART as its firmware uses it, reduced exactly as src/hosts/accent_sa.py reduces
 * it: whole bytes, no baud rate, no framing.
 *
 *   port 20h  in: the received byte (reading it drops RxRDY, and with it RST 6.5); out: a byte sent to the host
 *   port 21h  in: status 85h (TxRDY, TxEMPTY, DSR: the host's DTR is up) | 02h while a byte waits (RxRDY)
 *             out: after a reset, the mode word; then commands (bit 5 = RTS, bit 6 = internal reset: a mode word
 *             follows)
 *
 * The host's bytes wait in a queue; one is loaded (RxRDY) only while none is waiting and the firmware holds RTS up
 * (its handshake: command 37h raises it, 15h drops it while its buffer is full).  MIT.
