"""The Accent SA host in C (src/csrc/accentsa, MAME's 8085: hosts/accent_sa_c.py) against the Python host
(hosts/accent_sa.py, the reference), on a scripted session, the same chip model (SSI263C) on both sides.

    python src/csrc/accentsa/compare_accent_sa.py [--quick] [--only greeting|commands|driver]

The session, in three parts (three units, each from power-on):
  greeting  the "Accent ready." greeting heard out, flushed, then texts with punctuation, numbers and money in 50 ms
            blocks.  It holds one interrupt accepted at the end of the Python host's slice (below).
  commands  boot(), then twice a command (ESC R H, ESC P 3), 50 ms, and a short text: short, and it holds one too.
  driver    the add-on's way: boot() (the greeting flushed), the settings commands _speakJob sends (ESC R, P, V, M),
            texts in 30 ms blocks, a capital's pitch with snap_pitch, a cancel (Ctrl-X) in the middle of an
            utterance, then another text.
--quick: the greeting heard out and flushed without the texts after it, the commands part, and the driver part
without its middle texts.  --only: one part.

Predicates, for the C host as it stands (the Python host's counting, python_slices: the migration candidate): every
SSI-263 write identical in order and VALUE; every write's chip TIME identical, exactly; the audio identical block for
block; and the two counting differences between the hosts (as_board.h) seen as often on each side -- an acceptance that
ended the Python host's slice (its vector's instruction ran in the next slice) against the board's carried count, a
TRAP raised in EI's shadow (held one instruction by the Python core) against the board's held count.  The Python side
is counted by instrumenting its I8085.run; the C side by the board.

Reported and classified, not a predicate: the C host with the core's own counting (SSI263_ACCENT_SA_SLICES=chip,
experimental): which writes move, by how much, and after which counting event.

Must-fail controls: ACCENTSA_COMPARE_FLIP=1 flips one C write's value before comparing; ACCENTSA_COMPARE_SLICES=chip
compares the C host on the core's own counting, which the counting predicate must catch (its writes stay identical).
